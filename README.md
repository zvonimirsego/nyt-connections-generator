# *NYT Connections* generator
A project made in Python which uses skills learned while taking this course: [link](https://www.mathos.unios.hr/en/kolegiji/racunalno-jezikoslovlje/). Using libraries `nltk` and `gensim`, it uses `gensim`'s Word2Vec model to make an instance of a single *NTY Connections* "game".
